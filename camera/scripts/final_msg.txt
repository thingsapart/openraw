NOTE:

This application will run a Raspberry Pi CM5 compute module on a Waveshare CM5-NANO-B carrier board. A 1280x960 OLED electronic viewfinder is connected to HDMI, a 800x480 4.3" Waveshare DSI LCD is connected to MIPI0, and an IMX585 camera module is connected to MIPI1. This is all housed in a Rangefinder-style camera housing - ie this is a Raspberry Pi CM5-based camera!

Avoid adding dependencies unless you have to, but balance this with having to write a lot of "one-time" code. Eg when doing simple HTML parsing, maybe avoid a dependency, but add a comment to revise later if needed. Heed these comments and suggest rewriting code if it becomes too large (but only suggest! don't just rewrite it).

Do not add comments like "FIX: ..." that describe what was fixed in _this step_/session, they will be obsolete soon enough and just clutter the file. Only add comments describing long-term pre-conditions, explaining the code as-written and so on.

Print blocks of changes as diffs. We use a special diffing format to automatically apply changes. Please follow this template.

Format every diff the following way:

"
#>>>>> {full filename and path as passed in}
```
{full original text section that will be replaced. print the full section verbatim here!}
#=====
{changes to replace the above section with}
```
#<<<<< end
"

For example:

"
#>>>>> config.yaml
```
system:
  theme: light
#=====
system:
  theme: dark
```
#<<<<< end
"

When creating new files leave out the {original part} as well as the "#=====" separator.
