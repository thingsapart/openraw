#!/bin/bash

# A script to concatenate a list of files into a single formatted text block
# and copy it to the clipboard.
#
# Usage:
#   ./concat_files.sh                  - Processes files listed in data/files_default.txt.
#   ./concat_files.sh file1.c *.h      - Processes specified files, ignoring the default list.
#   ./concat_files.sh + file1.c *.h    - Adds specified files to the list from data/files_default.txt.
#   ./concat_files.sh --print          - Prints to stdout instead of copying. Can be combined with other arguments.
#
# Note: Options like --print and + must come before file arguments.
#   Example: ./concat_files.sh --print + file1.c

# --- Configuration ---
# The default list of files is read from this file, one pattern per line.
DEFAULT_FILES_CONFIG="data/files_default.txt"

# --- Script Logic ---

# Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status.
set -e

# --- Find a suitable clipboard command ---
if command -v pbcopy >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  COPY_CMD="pbcopy"
elif command -v wl-copy >/dev/null 2>&1; then

elif command -v xclip >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  # xclip requires the -selection clipboard option to interact with the system clipboard
  COPY_CMD="xclip -selection clipboard"
else

IMPORTANT: Performance is very important to this project and is one of the primary goals. Make sure every change is performant. Check PERF.md for relative perf figures and ask for updated values.

doc/HL_CEFD.md outlines a method to summarize Halide schedules, please use that to output a summary every time the pipeline/schedule is modified.

doc/HL_Optimize.md has general tips about pipeline optimization to keep in mind, but think deeply about the pipeline ang go beyond the prescripted thinking outlined there.


Please print out whole files, only those that you have changed. Do not give me just the section that has changed, do not omit parts with comments. Only print out the files that have been changed.

NOTE:

Do not add comments like "FIX: ..." that describe what was fixed in _this step_/session, they will be obsolete soon enough and just clutter the file. Only add comments describing long-term pre-conditions, explaining the code as-written and so on.

Format every file output the following way: start with a "!>>> {filename}" followed by a markdown code block and end with "!<<< end".

EG:

"
>> MakeFile
```
...
```
<< end
